XMLTV script tv_grab_fi uses www.telkku.com as its source for TV
program information. I have been using that forever in my DVB
system. Unfortunately, since the latest update of telkku.com, the data
has become unreliable (like invalid end times etc.).

I found out that another website (www.tvnyt.fi) provides the TV
program information for Finland already in structured format (JSON). I
decided to implement a somewhat compliant alternative of tv_grab_fi in
Python that uses tvnyt.fi as its data source.
